# Image-Encryption-Decryption-using-Chaos-Theory
This project aims to successfully encrypt and decrypt an image signal using the method of Chaos Theory. A theoretical and mathematical model of the encryption technique will be developed, and the resulting system of equations will be solved numerically on a computer. The specific objectives are presented below:

Develop a model of encryption technique, which will be based on the Chaos theory equations.
Make suitable assumptions and make the problem tractable.
Derive the governing equations from the first principles of Chaos Theory.
Formulate the initial conditions required for the proposed equations to show random behaviour.
Choose the correct set of property values and parameters.
Adopt efficient numerical methods to reduce the time of computation.
Write a computer program to perform the encryption method for a sample image signal.
Successfully retrieve the original signal by decrypting the encryption using the reverse procedure.
Determine the computational time and efficiency of the method
This project was done as a Course Project alongside two fellow students, Archit Dhakar and Aryan Sahu. This was done in the course MA203: Numerical Methods, guided by Professor Dilip Srinivas Sundaram and Professor Aksha Vatwani.
